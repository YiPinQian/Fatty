Fatty Singapore AI is an Artificial Intelligence base model,  
born from 32 GB RAM CPU (no CUDA) -> 6 GB GPU -> now Zotac 5070 Ti Solid Core OC 16 GB - FP32.  
All built the lean way, proving sovereign containment from constraint to inheritance.

Note: 2GB not tested, if anyone has a 2gb device, please help to try on it during Beta Trial Testing release 🤣 thank you lar!

(quiet corner ⋅ no weights ⋅ no code ⋅ just love from one stubborn Singaporean from Yi Pin Qian)
